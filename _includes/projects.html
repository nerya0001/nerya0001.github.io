      <h3> Augmented Wav2Vec 2.0: ASR Improvement Using Data Augmentation for Under-Represented Languages </h3>
      <p>In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance for under-represented languages using data augmentation. </p>
      <p>Our approach augments the training data by synthesizing new speech data using a combination of noise injection, speed changes, and frequency masking. We show that our technique significantly improves the ASR performance for under-represented languages.</p>

    <h3> Knowledge Base </h3>
    <p> This obsidian vault contains a lot of the notes that I have taken and materials I've accumulated during my degree's courses. When starting my degree, one ambition of mine was to open-source as much as I can from it so that many different people can profit from it. This is an ongoing project that will forever grow as I continue to learn new things.</p>

    <h3> RUDP Chat app </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Networking, RDP, UI, System design</li>
    </ul>
    <p> In this project we implemented a chat application that consists of:
      <ul>
        <li>1. Basic messaging and file transfer over TCP.</li>
        <li>2. Transfer of files over UDP using the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_User_Datagram_Protocol" target="_blank">RUDP</a> protocol.</li>
        <li>3. Managing users, files and messaging with <a class="link" href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a>.</li>
        <li>4. Gui for the client side is made with the <a class="link" href="https://kivy.org/#aboutus" target="_blank">Kivy</a> and <a class="link" href="https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD" target="_blank">KivyMD</a> frameworks.</li>

    <h3> Flask Trading Site </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Flask, API </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Trading site, developed with Flask as part of Harvard University online course. A web app via which you can manage portfolios of stocks. </p>
    <p>Not only will this tool allow you to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let you buy (okay, “buy”) and sell (okay, “sell”) stocks by querying IEX for stocks’ prices.Learnt to develop with flask, including the use of API (for the stocks info and prices)</p>

    <h3> Directed Graphs Algorithms </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Algotithms, UI, Graphs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal of this project is to design and implement two key interfaces:
      <ul>
        <li> Weighted directed graph interface.</li>
        <li> Weighted directed graphs algorithms interface.  </li>
      </ul>
      And also to represent the graph in an interactive graphical interface (matplotlib/drawGraph) that will introduce the algorithms.</p>
